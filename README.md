## 🚀 Project Journey & Methodology

### 🔹 Project Proposal
The journey began with a detailed proposal outlining business objectives, available data, and the planned analytical approach.  
Key goals included understanding **customer segments**, **sales patterns**, and **credit risks**.

### 🔹 Data Collection & Preparation
Transactional data was collected from the jewelry shop, including **sales, credit payments, product categories, and customer information**.  
Data cleaning and preprocessing were performed in **Python** to ensure accuracy and consistency.

### 🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Using the Jupyter notebook **`BDM_Project_Analysis_Code.ipynb`**, descriptive statistics and visualizations were generated to identify **trends, outliers, and relationships**.  
Techniques included correlation analysis, segmentation, and time-series exploration.

### 🔹 Mid-Term Review
The mid-term report summarized **interim findings, challenges faced, and adjustments** to the methodology.  
Feedback from mentors was incorporated to refine the analysis and focus on **high-impact areas**.

### 🔹 Advanced Analytics & Forecasting
Machine learning models (e.g., **SARIMA for sales forecasting**) and statistical methods were applied to:  
- Predict future sales  
- Analyze delayed payments  
- Optimize inventory  

Clear **visualizations** were created to communicate results effectively.
